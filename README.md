Technical Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08161.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08161.pdf)

h2oGPT is a large language model (LLM) fine-tuning framework and chatbot UI with document(s) question-answer capabilities.  Documents help to **ground** LLMs against hallucinations by providing them context relevant to the instruction.  h2oGPT is fully permissive Apache V2 open-source project for 100% private and secure use of LLMs and document embeddings for document question-answer.

Welcome!  Join us and make an issue or a PR, and contribute to making the best fine-tuned LLMs, chatbot UI, and document question-answer framework!

### Supported OS and Hardware

![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)

**GPU** mode requires CUDA support via torch and transformers.  A 6.9B (or 12GB) model in 8-bit uses 8GB (or 13GB) of GPU memory. 8-bit or 4-bit precision can further reduce memory requirements down no more than about 6.5GB when asking a question about your documents (see [low-memory mode](docs/FAQ.md#low-memory-mode)).

**CPU** mode uses GPT4ALL and LLaMa.cpp, e.g. gpt4all-j, requiring about 14GB of system RAM in typical use.

GPU and CPU mode tested on variety of NVIDIA GPUs in Ubuntu 18-22, but any modern Linux variant should work.  MACOS support tested on Macbook Pro running Monterey v12.3.1 using CPU mode.

### Apache V2 ChatBot with LangChain Integration

- [**LangChain**](docs/README_LangChain.md) equipped Chatbot integration and streaming responses
- **Persistent** database using Chroma or in-memory with FAISS
- **Original** content url links and scores to rank content against query
- **Private** offline database of any documents ([PDFs, Images, and many more](docs/README_LangChain.md#supported-datatypes))
- **Upload** documents via chatbot into shared space or only allow scratch space
- **Control** data sources and the context provided to LLM
- **Efficient** use of context using instruct-tuned LLMs (no need for many examples)
- **API** for client-server control
- **CPU and GPU** support from variety of HF models, and CPU support using GPT4ALL and LLaMa cpp
- **Linux, MAC, and Windows** support

### Apache V2 Data Preparation code, Training code, and Models

- **Variety** of models (h2oGPT, WizardLM, Vicuna, OpenAssistant, etc.) supported
- **Fully Commercially** Apache V2 code, data and models
- **High-Quality** data cleaning of large open-source instruction datasets
- **LoRA** and **QLoRA** (low-rank approximation) efficient 4-bit, 8-bit and 16-bit fine-tuning and generation
- **Large** (up to 65B parameters) models built on commodity or enterprise GPUs (single or multi node)
- **Evaluate** performance using RLHF-based reward models

All open-source datasets and models are posted on [ü§ó H2O.ai's Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/h2oai/).

Also check out [H2O LLM Studio](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio) for our no-code LLM fine-tuning framework!

### Roadmap

- Integration of code and resulting LLMs with downstream applications and low/no-code platforms
- Complement h2oGPT chatbot with search and other APIs
- High-performance distributed training of larger models on trillion tokens
- Enhance the model's code completion, reasoning, and mathematical capabilities, ensure factual correctness, minimize hallucinations, and avoid repetitive output
- Add other tools like search
- Add agents for SQL and CSV question/answer

### Getting Started

First one needs a Python 3.10 environment.  For help installing a Python 3.10 environment, see [Install Python 3.10 Environment](docs/INSTALL.md#install-python-environment).  On newer Ubuntu systems and environment may be installed by just doing:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gcc python3.10-dev
virtualenv -p python3 h2ogpt
source h2ogpt/bin/activate
```
Check your installation by doing:
```bash
python --version # should say 3.10.xx
pip --version  # should say pip 23.x.y ... (python 3.10)
```
On some systems, `pip` still refers back to the system one, then one can use `python -m pip` or `pip3` instead of `pip` or try `python3` instead of `python`.

#### TLDR

After Python 3.10 environment installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt.git
cd h2ogpt
# fix any bad env
pip uninstall -y pandoc pypandoc pypandoc-binary
# broad support, but no training-time or data creation dependencies
for fil in requirements.txt reqs_optional/requirements_optional_langchain.txt reqs_optional/requirements_optional_gpt4all.txt reqs_optional/requirements_optional_langchain.gpllike.txt reqs_optional/requirements_optional_langchain.urls.txt ; do pip install -r $fil ; done
# Optional: support docx, pptx, ArXiv, etc.
sudo apt-get install -y libmagic-dev poppler-utils tesseract-ocr libreoffice
# Optional: for supporting unstructured package
python -m nltk.downloader all
````

Place all documents in `user_path` or upload in UI.

UI using GPU with at least 24GB with streaming:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oasst1-512-12b --load_8bit=True  --score_model=None --langchain_mode='UserData' --user_path=user_path
```
UI using CPU
```bash
python generate.py --base_model='llama' --prompt_type=wizard2 --score_model=None --langchain_mode='UserData' --user_path=user_path
```

### Development
