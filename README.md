# h2oGPT

Turn ‚òÖ into ‚≠ê (top-right corner) if you like the project!

Query and summarize your documents (PDFs, Excel, Word, Images, Code, Text, MarkDown, etc.) or just chat using local private GPT LLMs (Falcon, Vicuna, WizardLM including AutoGPTQ) sourced from vector database (Chroma, FAISS, Weaviate) using accurate embeddings (instruct-large, all-MiniLM-L6-v1, etc.).  Supports Linux, Windows, or MAC for both CPU and GPU.  Clean UI or CLI supported with LLM streaming, with bake-off mode against any number of models in UI.  OpenAI-compliant Python client access to the server.

**GPU** mode requires CUDA support via torch and transformers.  A 6.9B (or 12GB) model in 8-bit uses 8GB (or 13GB) of GPU memory. 8-bit precision, 4-bit precision, and AutoGPTQ can further reduce memory requirements down no more than about 6.5GB when asking a question about your documents (see [low-memory mode](docs/FAQ.md#low-memory-mode)).

**CPU** mode uses GPT4ALL and LLaMa.cpp, e.g. gpt4all-j, requiring about 14GB of system RAM in typical use.

GPU and CPU mode tested on variety of NVIDIA GPUs in Ubuntu 18-22, but any modern Linux variant should work.  MACOS support tested on Macbook Pro running Monterey v12.3.1 using CPU mode, as well as MAC M1 using MPS.

### Apache V2 ChatBot with LangChain Integration

See how we compare to other tools like PrivateGPT, see our [comparisons](docs/README_LangChain.md#what-is-h2ogpts-langchain-integration-like).

- [**LangChain**](docs/README_LangChain.md) equipped Chatbot integration and streaming responses
- **Persistent** database using Chroma and Weaviate or in-memory with FAISS
- **Original** content url links and scores to rank content against query
- **Private** offline database of any documents ([PDFs, Images, and many more](docs/README_LangChain.md#supported-datatypes))
- **Upload** documents via chatbot into shared space or only allow scratch space
- **Control** data sources and the context provided to LLM
- **Efficient** use of context using instruct-tuned LLMs (no need for many examples)
- **API** for client-server control
- **CPU and GPU** support from variety of HF models, and CPU support using GPT4ALL and LLaMa cpp
- **Linux, MAC, and Windows** support

### Apache V2 Data Preparation code, Training code, and Models

- **Variety** of models (h2oGPT, WizardLM, Vicuna, OpenAssistant, etc.) supported
- **Fully Commercially** Apache V2 code, data and models
- **High-Quality** data cleaning of large open-source instruction datasets
- **LoRA** and **QLoRA** (low-rank approximation) efficient 4-bit, 8-bit and 16-bit fine-tuning and generation
- **Large** (up to 65B parameters) models built on commodity or enterprise GPUs (single or multi node)
- **Evaluate** performance using RLHF-based reward models
- **Hugging Face** models and datasets on [ü§ó H2O.ai's Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/h2oai/).

Also check out [H2O LLM Studio](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio) for our no-code LLM fine-tuning framework!

### Roadmap

- Integration of code and resulting LLMs with downstream applications and low/no-code platforms
- Complement h2oGPT chatbot with search and other APIs
- High-performance distributed training of larger models on trillion tokens
- Enhance the model's code completion, reasoning, and mathematical capabilities, ensure factual correctness, minimize hallucinations, and avoid repetitive output
- Add other tools like search
- Add agents for SQL and CSV question/answer

## Getting Started

First one needs a Python 3.10 environment.  For help installing a Python 3.10 environment, see [Install Python 3.10 Environment](docs/INSTALL.md#install-python-environment).  On newer Ubuntu systems and environment may be installed by just doing:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gcc python3.10-dev
virtualenv -p python3 h2ogpt
source h2ogpt/bin/activate
```
or use conda:
```bash
conda create -n h2ogpt -y
conda activate h2ogpt
conda install python=3.10 -c conda-forge -y
```
Check your installation by doing:
```bash
python --version # should say 3.10.xx
pip --version  # should say pip 23.x.y ... (python 3.10)
```
On some systems, `pip` still refers back to the system one, then one can use `python -m pip` or `pip3` instead of `pip` or try `python3` instead of `python`.

### TLDR

For [MACOS](docs/README_MACOS.md#macos) and [Windows 10/11](docs/README_WINDOWS.md) please follow their instructions.

On Ubuntu, after Python 3.10 environment installed do:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt.git
cd h2ogpt
# fix any bad env
pip uninstall -y pandoc pypandoc pypandoc-binary
# broad support, but no training-time or data creation dependencies

# CPU only:
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# GPU only:
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
Then run:
```bash
# Required for Doc Q/A: LangChain:
pip install -r reqs_optional/requirements_optional_langchain.txt
# Required for CPU: LLaMa/GPT4All:
pip install -r reqs_optional/requirements_optional_gpt4all.txt
# Optional: PyMuPDF/ArXiv:
pip install -r reqs_optional/requirements_optional_langchain.gpllike.txt
# Optional: Selenium/PlayWright:
pip install -r reqs_optional/requirements_optional_langchain.urls.txt
# Optional: support docx, pptx, ArXiv, etc. required by some python packages
sudo apt-get install -y libmagic-dev poppler-utils tesseract-ocr libreoffice
# Optional: for supporting unstructured package
python -m nltk.downloader all
# Optional: For AutoGPTQ support on x86_64 linux
pip uninstall -y auto-gptq ; CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.8  GITHUB_ACTIONS=true pip install auto-gptq --no-cache-dir
```
See [AutoGPTQ](docs/README_GPU.md#gpu-cuda) for more details for AutoGPTQ and other GPU installation aspects.

Place all documents in `user_path` or upload in UI ([Help with UI](docs/README_ui.md)).

UI using GPU with at least 24GB with streaming:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oasst1-512-12b --load_8bit=True  --score_model=None --langchain_mode='UserData' --user_path=user_path
```
UI using CPU
```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GGML/resolve/main/WizardLM-7B-uncensored.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin
python generate.py --base_model='llama' --prompt_type=wizard2 --score_model=None --langchain_mode='UserData' --user_path=user_path
```

If using OpenAI for the LLM is ok, but you want documents to be parsed and embedded locally, then do:
```bash
python generate.py  --inference_server=openai_chat --base_model=gpt-3.5-turbo --score_model=None
```
and perhaps you want better image caption performance and focus local GPU on that, then do:
```bash
python generate.py  --inference_server=openai_chat --base_model=gpt-3.5-turbo --score_model=None --captions_model=Salesforce/blip2-flan-t5-xl
```

Add `--share=True` to make gradio server visible via sharable URL.  If you see an error about protobuf, try:
```bash
pip install protobuf==3.20.0
```

Once all files are downloaded, the CLI and UI can be run in offline mode, see [offline mode](docs/README_offline.md).
