### Install h2oGPT

Docker is recommended for Linux, Windows, and MAC for full capabilities.  Linux Script also has full capability, while Windows and MAC scripts have less capabilities than using Docker.

### Development

- To create a development environment for training and generation, follow the [installation instructions](docs/INSTALL.md).
- To fine-tune any LLM models on your data, follow the [fine-tuning instructions](docs/FINETUNE.md).
- To run h2oGPT tests:
    ```bash
    pip install requirements-parser pytest-instafail pytest-random-order playsound==1.3.0
    conda install -c conda-forge gst-python -y
    sudo apt-get install gstreamer-1.0
    pip install pygame
    GPT_H2O_AI=0 CONCURRENCY_COUNT=1 pytest --instafail -s -v tests
    # for openai server test on already-running local server
    pytest -s -v -n 4 openai_server/test_openai_server.py::test_openai_client
    ```
  or tweak/run `tests/test4gpus.sh` to run tests in parallel.

### Why H2O.ai?

Our [Makers](https://h2o.ai/company/team/) at [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai) have built several world-class Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI platforms:
- #1 open-source machine learning platform for the enterprise [H2O-3](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3)
- The world's best AutoML (Automatic Machine Learning) with [H2O Driverless AI](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/h2o-driverless-ai/)
- No-Code Deep Learning with [H2O Hydrogen Torch](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/hydrogen-torch/)
- Document Processing with Deep Learning in [Document AI](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/document-ai/)

We also built platforms for deployment and monitoring, and for data wrangling and governance:
- [H2O MLOps](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/operate/h2o-mlops/) to deploy and monitor models at scale
- [H2O Feature Store](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/feature-store/) in collaboration with AT&T
- Open-source Low-Code AI App Development Frameworks [Wave](https://wave.h2o.ai/) and [Nitro](https://nitro.h2o.ai/)
- Open-source Python [datatable](https://github.com/h2oai/datatable/) (the engine for H2O Driverless AI feature engineering)

Many of our customers are creating models and deploying them enterprise-wide and at scale in the [H2O AI Cloud](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/):
- Multi-Cloud or on Premises
- [Managed Cloud (SaaS)](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/managed)
- [Hybrid Cloud](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/hybrid)
- [AI Appstore](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o-ai-cloud/)

We are proud to have over 25 (of the world's 280) [Kaggle Grandmasters](https://h2o.ai/company/team/kaggle-grandmasters/) call H2O home, including three Kaggle Grandmasters who have made it to world #1.
