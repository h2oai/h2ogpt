There is the more or less solid and weight-bearing portion toward your front, called “the vertebral body” (with the discs in between). And then there’s this flying buttress–looking piece that sticks off the back (the “vertebral arch”). And there is a very important space between the two sections. The “hollow” down the middle of your spine is really a space between these two segments of the vertebra. The vertebra is one solid piece of bone but with two very distinct segments and a hole down the middle where the spinal cord goes. \nThe Spinal Column\n\nDo you see the spiny-looking pieces in the picture, above, sticking off the vertebrae? Those are pieces of the vertebral arch. They are called “the spinous processes” (no one cares), and they are basically anchor points. That’s where ligaments can attach muscles to the vertebrae. If you’re a sailor, think of cleats on the deck, for ropes. When you reach back and feel the spiny part of your back, you’re feeling the “spinous processes” or the cleats. By the way, the ligaments or sinews are the lines (think “stays” on a sailboat) that hold your spine erect. Without stays, the mast on a sailboat would flop around and break in no time; with stays, the mast on a well-designed sailboat is remarkably stable. Flexible, like your spine, but stable and strong, too. \nOkeydoke, on to the discs. This is familiar territory to most of us. You hear about discs all the time. “Bulging discs,” “pinched discs,” “slipped discs,” “ruptured discs” and so on. They are basically washers to keep the weight-bearing parts of the vertebrae from rubbing on one another and to put some “give” into your back. You cannot have an articulated stack of bones without a wonderfully effective stack of washers to keep ’em apart, and you do. Think of them as very tough jelly doughnuts, as I mentioned before. There is a tough, fibrous layer on the outside and a gooey or liquid core on the inside. They act as shock absorbers and have a lot to do with letting you bend. Dysfunctional discs can be a major source of problems and pain. \nA YOUNG PERSON’S PROBLEMS\nThis is interesting. Bulging and actually ruptured discs are mostly a young person’s problem, people in their thirties (and you kids are welcome to them; they really hurt). Older people have horrendous problems, too; after all, some 35 percent of people from ages forty-five to sixty-five have serious back pain. But usually not this particular horror. Which also means that more younger people are going to get bundled off to the surgeon, if the problem is grim enough. Older people have disc problems, too, but nowhere near as often. \nTake a long look at the pictures on the next pages. They show you how the spinal cord, spine, and discs work together. First is a side view depicting how the brain, spinal cord, and spine are positioned in the body. Second is a close-up of a segment made up of two vertebrae with their disc (in gray) in between and the spinal cord and nerve roots visible. Notice how the rear parts of the adjoining vertebrae form a canal through which the spinal cord runs from top to bottom. Also notice how the two adjoining vertebrae form holes, or “foramina,” on the sides where the nerve roots come out of the spine. Those holes are super-important: The holes can become smaller from disc degeneration or movement of the vertebrae on top of each other. And the nerve that comes out of the hole is pressured, and it hurts like blazes. Not to get too scary, but when things really go to hell and you actually rupture or split the disc open with your ridiculous posture or whatnot, the pain really goes over the top. (Good news: You hear about ruptured discs all the time, but they are comparatively rare.) Bones wear on bones, discs hurt like crazy, and the stuff in the middle squirts all over the place. Which is bad because it causes severe chemical pain in the nerves. Not so good. When we say that there are times when traditional medicine (surgery) has a critical role, this is one of them. \nNote the bits of bone to the left in the close-up side view vertebral segment. These are “the facet joints.” The point of this picture is to show how they are right next to the spinal cord and near one of the nerve exit spots. They are well placed, in other words, to raise hell if things go wrong with them. I forgot to mention this: The surfaces of the facet joints are covered in cartilage, which allows smooth movement in a healthy spine. So what? The point is that this cartilage can be abraded or torn by dumb moves, too, and that hurts as well. \nHere are two more views, below. Note the sort of circular thing with the lighter insides. That’s a cross section of a disc, seen from the top. \n\nLigaments and Tendons\nAll right, that‘s the spinal cord and the spinal column. But they would not stand alone without a ton of support. Think of the spinal column as a slender reed. If you press down on it at all from above (or the sides), it will bend crazily. Indeed, it cannot sustain any weight at all to speak of. But now, add a bunch of support lines from the pole to a solid support, and it’s a different story. Our backbone has a lot of very sturdy support lines called ligaments and tendons (ligaments connect bone to bone; tendons connect bone to muscle.) There are an awful lot of ligaments connected to the spine. The following picture gives you the idea. \nHere’s another thing you need to know: Ligaments can become deformed or sprained because of bad posture, a persistent pattern of bad movements, or an injury. When that happens to a ligament, the joints those ligaments were supporting “get loose” and can slip around. That is really bad. Here is a language alert: A “sprain” is an unhealthy stretch or tear of a ligament, and a “strain” is an unhealthy stretch or tear in a tendon or muscle. Look at the picture on the opposite page: there are a ton of ligaments here, all waiting to go haywire if you are foolish or unlucky. \nSpinal Ligaments',
