## Client APIs

A Gradio API and an OpenAI-compliant API are supported.  One can also use `curl` to some extent for basic API.

### OpenAI Compliant Python Client Library

An OpenAI compliant client is available. Refer the [README](../client/README.md) for more details.

### Gradio Client API

h2oGPT's `generate.py` by default runs a gradio server, which also gives access to client API using Gradio client.  One can use it with h2oGPT, or independently of h2oGPT repository by installing an env:
```bash
conda create -n gradioclient -y
conda activate gradioclient
conda install python=3.10 -y
pip install gradio_client

# Download Gradio Wrapper code if GradioClient class used, not needed for native Gradio Client
# No wheel for now
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/h2ogpt/main/gradio_utils/grclient.py
mkdir -p gradio_utils
mv grclient.py gradio_utils
```

Run client code with Gradio's native client:
```python
from gradio_client import Client
import ast

HOST_URL = "http://localhost:7860"
client = Client(HOST_URL)

# string of dict for input
kwargs = dict(instruction_nochat='Who are you?')
res = client.predict(str(dict(kwargs)), api_name='/submit_nochat_api')

# string of dict for output
response = ast.literal_eval(res)['response']
print(response)
```

One can also stream the response.  Here is a complete example code of streaming to console each updated text fragment so appears to stream in console:
```python
from gradio_client import Client
import ast
import time

HOST = 'http://localhost:7860'
client = Client(HOST)
api_name = '/submit_nochat_api'
prompt = "Who are you?"
kwargs = dict(instruction_nochat=prompt, stream_output=True)

job = client.submit(str(dict(kwargs)), api_name=api_name)

text_old = ''
while not job.done():
    outputs_list = job.communicator.job.outputs
    if outputs_list:
        res = job.communicator.job.outputs[-1]
        res_dict = ast.literal_eval(res)
        text = res_dict['response']
        new_text = text[len(text_old):]
        if new_text:
            print(new_text, end='', flush=True)
            text_old = text
        time.sleep(0.01)
# handle case if never got streaming response and already done
res_final = job.outputs()
if len(res_final) > 0:
    res = res_final[-1]
    res_dict = ast.literal_eval(res)
    text = res_dict['response']
    new_text = text[len(text_old):]
    print(new_text)
```

### h2oGPT Gradio Wrapper

One can run client code with h2oGPT wrapper class for Gradio's client, which adds extra exception handling and adds h2oGPT specific calls.

For talking to just LLM, Document Q/A, summarization, and extraction, one can do:
```python
def test_readme_example(local_server):
    # self-contained example used for readme, to be copied to README_CLIENT.md if changed, setting local_server = True at first
    import os
    # The grclient.py file can be copied from h2ogpt repo and used with local gradio_client for example use
    from gradio_utils.grclient import GradioClient

    if local_server:
        client = GradioClient("http://0.0.0.0:7860")
    else:
        h2ogpt_key = os.getenv('H2OGPT_KEY') or os.getenv('H2OGPT_H2OGPT_KEY')
        if h2ogpt_key is None:
            return
        # if you have API key for public instance:
        client = GradioClient("https://gpt.h2o.ai", h2ogpt_key=h2ogpt_key)

    # LLM
    print(client.question("Who are you?"))

    url = "https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf"

    # Q/A
    print(client.query("What is whisper?", url=url))
    # summarization (map_reduce over all pages if top_k_docs=-1)
    print(client.summarize("What is whisper?", url=url, top_k_docs=3))
    # extraction (map per page)
    print(client.extract("Give bullet for all key points", url=url, top_k_docs=3))
test_readme_example(local_server=True)
```

#### Other API calls

For other ways to use gradio client, see example [test code](../client_test.py) or other tests in our [tests](https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt/blob/main/tests/test_client_calls.py).  E.g. `test_client_chat_stream_langchain_steps3` etc. [tests](https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt/blob/main/tests/test_client_calls.py) use many different API calls for docs etc.

Any element in [gradio_runner.py](../gradio_runner.py) with `api_name` defined can be accessed via the gradio client.

#### Listing models

```python
>>> from gradio_client import Client
>>> client = Client('http://localhost:7860')
Loaded as API: http://localhost:7860/ âœ”
>>> import ast
>>> res = client.predict(api_name='/model_names')
>>> {x['base_model']: x['max_seq_len'] for x in ast.literal_eval(res)}
{'h2oai/h2ogpt-4096-llama2-70b-chat': 4046, 'lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5-16k': 16334, 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1': 4046, 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613': 4046, 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613': 16335, 'gpt-4-0613': 8142, 'gpt-4-32k-0613': 32718}
```

### h2oGPT Server options for efficient Summarization and Extraction

One can choose h2oGPT server to have `--async_output=True` and `--num_async=10` (or some optimal value) to enable full parallel summarization when the h2oGPT server uses `--inference_server` that points to Gradio Inference Server, vLLM, text-generation inference (TGI) server, or OpenAI servers to allow for high tokens/sec.

### Curl Client API

As long as objects within the `gradio_runner.py` for a given api_name are for a function without `gr.State()` objects, then curl can work.  Full `curl` capability is not supported in Gradio [yet](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/4932).

For example, for a server launched as:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ --load_gptq="model" --use_safetensors=True --prompt_type=llama2 --save_dir=fooasdf --system_prompt='auto'
```
one can use the `submit_nochat_plain_api` that has no `state` objects to perform chat via `curl` by doing:
```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:7860/api/submit_nochat_plain_api -X POST -d '{"data": ["{\"instruction_nochat\": \"Who are you?\"}"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
and get back for a 7B LLaMA2-chat GPTQ model:

`{"data":["{'response': \" Hello! I'm just an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and informative responses to your questions.

This contains the full dictionary of `data` from `curl` operation as well is the data contents that are a string of a dictionary like when using the API `submit_nochat_api` for Gradio client.  This inner string of a dictionary can be parsed as a literal python string to get keys `response`, `source`, `save_dict`, where `save_dict` contains meta data about the query such as generation hyperparameters, tokens generated, etc.
