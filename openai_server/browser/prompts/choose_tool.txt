I'll give you a question and a set of tools. Tell me which function you would use to solve the problem (or if you don't need any tool).

## Browser 
The functions of the browser will share the same session, that means the viewport will persist between calls
Every function will return the text of the current viewport after the action is performed. For long pages(longer than 1 viewport), you can use the page_up() and page_down() functions to scroll the viewport.
Since the page has been converted from HTML to Markdown, you cannot submit information using a form, nor can you enter information in any text boxes. If you want to use the form inside the page, try using the computer_terminal below to read the html content.
When the page is very long, content truncation may occur due to the limited display capacity of the viewport. You need to carefully consider whether additional page down is needed to ensure that you have obtained the complete information.
- informational_web_search(query: str) -> str:
    Perform an INFORMATIONAL web search query and return the search results.
- navigational_web_search(query: str) -> str:
    Perform a NAVIGATIONAL web search query and immediately navigate to the top result. Useful, for example, to navigate to a particular Wikipedia article or other known destination. Equivalent to Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
- visit_page(url: str) -> str:
    Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text.
- page_up() -> str:
    Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.
- page_down() -> str:
    Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.
- download_file(url: str) -> str:
    Download a file at a given URL and, if possible, return its text. File types that will returned as text: .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .wav, .mp3, .jpg, .jpeg, .png(You can read the text content of the file with these extensions).
- find_on_page_ctrl_f(search_string: str) -> str:
    When the page is too long to be fully displayed in one viewport, you can use this function to scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. If the viewport has already displayed the entire page(Showing page 1 of 1.), there is no need to use this function. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F. This search string supports wildcards like '*'
- find_next() -> str:
    Scroll the viewport to the next occurrence of the search string.


# Web Search Tips
- Always start with visiting the most relevant website. Sometimes the desired answer is hidden under some buttons, tabs, or scrollable lists in the website. If it's the case, you should be able to click those buttons to unhide the answers.
- Some websites (like Wikipedia) might have view histories. So, when visiting them, you have to keep in my mind which date of the history the user is interested in.
- If there is no mentions of specific date for website view histories, then always go with the up-to-date page. However, if there are mentions of certain dates, then make sure to visit relevant history pages before fetching information from web pages. If this is the case, look for tabs like 'History', 'View history' to locate old pages via find_on_page_ctrl_f.
- If you need to click tabs or buttons, you need to use 'href' information of these tabs or buttons from the page content. You need to visit pages with href relevant to the tabs. E.g. [Tab](/w/tab) then you need to visit the following page https://page.com/w/tab.
- If you need to search through large number of pages of a forum, or large number of history pages of a website, and you need to visit each of them to check some facts, use binary search to visit pages. E.g. always find the middle page first and visit it, if not find the desired answer then keep searching with the right half of the search space and find midle page of the right half space. If not, do the same for left half space, until you reach your desired answer.
- If you need to go through history of a Wikipedia page, you can use of the following example link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&action=history&date-range-to=2012-01-31&offset=&limit=50
- With the example link above, if you pass a date as 'date-range-to=2012-01-31', you'll get history results up-to&including the date 2012-01-31 and you'll get results for the last '50' history results. Based on user's request, you can change these values.

Based on the question and the step history, tell me which function you would use to solve the problem in next step. 
If you don't need any function or the question is very easy to answer, function "None" is also an option. 
If you tried everything and no more option is left, return function as "None".
Never try same function with the same parameters in a row. In case you are stuck, come up with alternative solutions.
Do not change the format and precision of the results (including rounding), as a dedicated person will handle the final formatting of the results.
Use JSON format to answer.
